# Hypered Now

Hypered Now is mostly an attempt at doing some Android development but here is
the functional goal:

Hypered Now is an Android application designed to receive notifications
generated by Hypered projects. It is an optional complement to other
communication channels such as emails and SMS. It provides nice possibilities,
e.g. blinking led, configuration options, minimal UI directly available on the
notification, ...

As an Android development attempt, it provides a Docker image for command-line
development (instead of using the Android Studio IDE).


## Docker image

The Docker image is defined in the `images/` directory. The built image is
named `images.reesd.com/reesd/android`. It contains `gradlew`, `adb`, ...


### Usage

Outside the container, e.g. in a CI environment:

```
$ ./build.sh
$ ./generate-key.sh  # Only once, interactive
$ ./next.sh          # Interactive
```

Or, within a container (to reuse the Gradle cache):

```
$ ./bash.sh
> cd /project
> ./compile.sh
> ./generate-key.sh  # Only once, interactive
> ./next.sh          # Interactive
```

The end result is `project/hypered-now.apk`.


### USB connection to an Android phone

- The phone should be in developer mode.
- In the developer settings, it should allow USB debugging.
- In some case it should be, or not, in file transfer mode.

```
$ ./bash.sh
> /project/adb-install.sh
```
